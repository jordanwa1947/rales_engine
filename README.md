Endpoints

All endpoints serialize and render a JSON response with the requested record(s). Each resource has an index and show endpoint/action for multiple and single records respectively. Also included are single finders and multi-finders for querying resources by attributes or a random action for a random resource.

Index Actions

/api/v1/merchants
/api/v1/invoices
/api/v1/items
/api/v1/invoice_items
/api/v1/customers
/api/v1/transactions

Show Actions

/api/v1/merchants/:id
/api/v1/invoices/:id
/api/v1/items/:id
/api/v1/invoice_items/:id
/api/v1/customers/:id
/api/v1/transactions/:id

Find Actions

Single Finders

Pass in query parameters associated with the the record by appending '?example_param=value' to the end.

/api/v1/merchants/find
/api/v1/invoices/find
/api/v1/items/find
/api/v1/invoice_items/find
/api/v1/customers/find
/api/v1/transactions/find

Example: GET /api/v1/merchants/find?name=Schroeder-Jerde

Multi-Finders

Multi-finders work much the same as the single finders.
Note that the single record is still in an array.

/api/v1/merchants/find_all
/api/v1/invoices/find_all
/api/v1/items/find_all
/api/v1/invoice_items/find_all
/api/v1/customers/find_all
/api/v1/transactions/find_all

Example: GET /api/v1/merchants/find_all?name=Schroeder-Jerde

Random

To get a random record, visit these endpoints

api/v1/merchants/random

Coming Soon:
api/v1/invoices/random
api/v1/items/random
api/v1/invoice_items/random
api/v1/customers/random
api/v1/transactions/random
